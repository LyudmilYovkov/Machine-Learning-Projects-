This project shows the usage of a simple linear regression model with more than one predictor. The dataset contains real-world data (source for downloading: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/auto-mpg-dataset) about cars and has the following column structure: ["Acceleration", "Displacement", "Horsepower", "MPG", "Weight"] with approximately 400 rows. As predictor variables are being chosen "Horsepower" and "Weight" while as a response variable is being chosen "MPG". Some different linear models can be built when including other table variables into the regression equation. A convenient way to select among a few possible predictors is to calculate the respective correlation coefficients. The goodness of every fit may be evaluated by calculating R-squared and RMSE on both training and test sets.
Graphical plots show the behaviour of the model on the training data and its evaluation on the test data. The results from the fitting procedure happening behind the scenes in the built-in MATLAB function fitnlm() are also in the foreground.
