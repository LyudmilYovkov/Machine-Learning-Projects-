This project shows the usage of a simple linear regression model with more than one predictor. The dataset contains real-world data (source for downloading: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/auto-mpg-dataset) about cars and has the following column structure: ["Acceleration", "Displacement", "Horsepower", "MPG", "Weight"]. As predictor variables are being chosen "Horsepower" and "Weight" while as a response variable is chosen "MPG". Some different linear models can be built when including other table variables into the regression equation. A convenient way to select among a few possible predictors is to calculate the respective correlation coefficients.
